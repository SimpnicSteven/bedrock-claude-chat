## Performance Optimization

### Slow network speed

Q: `I'm experiencing very slow network speeds on my devices.`
`<PROMPT>Are you connecting your devices via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable?`

A: `I'm connected via Wi-Fi.`
`<SOLUTION>
1. Try moving your devices closer to the router to improve Wi-Fi signal strength.
2. Check if there are any interference sources (e.g., microwaves, cordless phones) near the router and eliminate them if possible.
3. Consider upgrading to a newer Wi-Fi standard (e.g., 802.11ac or 802.11ax) if your devices support it.
`
`<CONFIRM>Do you understand the suggested solutions? Would you like to try them?`

A: `Yes, I understand and will try these solutions.`
`<CONFIRM>Great, please let me know if the issue persists after trying these steps.</CONFIRM>`

A: `No, I don't quite understand these solutions.`
`<SOLUTION>
Let me explain further:
- Moving your devices closer to the router can improve the Wi-Fi signal strength, resulting in better speeds.
- Interference from other electronic devices can degrade Wi-Fi performance, so try to keep the router away from potential sources of interference.
- If your devices support newer Wi-Fi standards like 802.11ac or 802.11ax, upgrading to a router that supports these standards can significantly improve your network speeds.
`
`<CONFIRM>Does this explanation help you understand the suggested solutions better? I'm happy to clarify further if needed.</CONFIRM>`

### High latency between devices

# Best Practices

When creating interactive dialog examples for the AI customer support, consider the following best practices:

1. **Break down complex issues into smaller steps**
   - For complex issues, break them down into smaller, more manageable steps to guide the user through the resolution process.
   - Use multiple `<PROMPT>` instructions to gather necessary information at each step.

2. **Provide clear and concise solutions**
   - Ensure that the solutions provided are easy to understand and follow.
   - Use numbered or bulleted lists to present step-by-step instructions clearly.

3. **Confirm user understanding**
   - Before providing a solution, use the `<CONFIRM>` instruction to ensure the user understands the issue correctly.
   - If the user seems confused, rephrase the issue or provide additional context.

4. **Offer alternative solutions**
   - If the initial solution does not resolve the issue, provide alternative solutions or troubleshooting steps.
   - Use the `<SOLUTION>` instruction to present each alternative solution clearly.

5. **Escalate to human support when necessary**
   - If the AI is unable to resolve the issue after multiple attempts, use the `<ESCALATE>` instruction to escalate the issue to a human support agent.
   - Provide a clear explanation to the user for the escalation.

6. **Maintain a friendly and patient tone**
   - Throughout the dialog, maintain a friendly and patient tone, acknowledging the user's frustration and assuring them of your commitment to resolving their issue.

7. **Test and refine the dialogs**
   - Regularly test the dialog examples with the AI system to identify any areas for improvement or refinement.
   - Incorporate feedback from users and support agents to enhance the dialog quality continuously.
